# How to contribute

#### Did you find a bug?
* __Ensure the bug was not already reported__ by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://LucHermitte/vim-clang/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://LucHermitte/vim-clang/issues). Be sure to include a __title and clear
  description__, as much relevant information as possible (vim version, libclang version, python version...), and a __code sample__ or an __executable test case__ demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

#### Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.
* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.
* Before submitting, please update the `CONTRIBUTORS` file with your name and contribution.


Thanks
