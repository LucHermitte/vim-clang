vim-clang
=========

Module to Interact with libclang (and clang\_indexer DB) from Vim.

[![Project Stats](https://www.openhub.net/p/21020/widgets/project_thin_badge.gif)](https://www.openhub.net/p/21020)

Features:
---------
* Provides an API to request information about the symbol under the cursor for Vim
* Inter-operates with clang\_indexer DB
    * Displays the references of the C++ symbol under the cursor with `<leader>r`
    * Displays the declaration(s) of the C++ symbol under the cursor with `<leader>d`
    * Displays the Subclasses of the C++ symbol under the cursor with `<leader>s`
    * Encapsulates the updating of clang\_indexer DB (which requires a project
      configuration compatible with BuildToolsWrappers format)

Rationale:
----------

While code indexation is already taken care of by LSP servers and plugins like
[COC](https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim) when plugged with
[ccls](https://github.com/MaskRay/ccls/), or
[clangd](https://clang.llvm.org/extra/clangd/), the
[Language Server Protocol](https://github.com/Microsoft/language-server-protocol)
doesn't standardize any way to request information about the current code.

From v2 onward, vim-clang new objective is to help building features that need
information about the code. Typical examples are
[lh-cpp](https://github.com/LucHermitte/lh-cpp) following commands and
features that'll be greatly improved by C++ code parsing done by libclang,
instead of being done in pure vimscript:
- [`:DOX`](https://github.com/LucHermitte/lh-cpp/blob/master/doc/Doxygen.md)
  that generates Doxygen comments
- `:GOTOIMPL` that generates a function definition from its declaration
- `:Override` that proposes functions from parent class(es) to override in
  current class.
- [_switch-enum_](https://github.com/LucHermitte/lh-cpp/blob/master/doc/Enums.md)
  that expands a `switch`-snippet with all the values from an enumeration

Installation Requirements:
-------------------------
* [Vim 8.0+](http://www.vim.org), compiled with python support,
* Python 3.x,
* [lh-vim-lib](http://github.com/LucHermitte/lh-vim), v4.7.1+
* libclang,
* libclang Python bindings,

Optional dependencies:

* [BuildToolsWrappers](http://github.com/LucHermitte/vim-build-tools-wrapper),
  to help detect compilation databases
* And for the clang\_indexer _deprecated_ features:
    * my fork of Michael Geddes' [buffer-menu](http://github.com/LucHermitte/lh-misc/blob/master/plugin/buffermenu.vim)
    * [clang\_indexer](https://github.com/LucHermitte/clang_indexer) if you wish to request information to it -- honestly, I'm using COC+ccls nowadays

With vim-addon-manager, just install `vim-clang`, and let VAM take care of
installing all the vim dependencies. You'll still have to install Vim, Python,
clang Python bindings, **and** optionally clang\_indexer by yourself.

Note: this script hasn't been registered yet to VAM addons list.

Options:
--------
* `g:clang_library_path` to force the version of `libclang.so` to use. By
  default, this library is searched in `$LD_LIBRARY_PATH`, then in `lib/`
  directories alongside `$PATH`.
* The options from clang\_complete apply regarding libclang configuration
  (`[bg]:clang_user_options` that defines how to use libclang)
* `[bg]:_[{ft}_]_clic_filename` that tells where clang\_indexer database is
  located
* `(bpg):BTW.compilation_dir` to look for `compile_commands.json`

* `g:clang_key_usr`, `g:clang_key_declarations`, `g:clang_key_references`, and
  `g:clang_key_subclasses`, to override default choices to trigger vim-clang
  features.

To do list:
-----------
* Interface _Ã  la_ `taglist()`
* Reimplements features from lh-dev and `lh-cpp#analysisLib*`.


Disclaimer:
-----------
This module is a fork of @exclipy's fork of
[clang\_complete](<https://github.com/exclipy/clang_complete>).
The functions dedicated to the interaction with clang\_indexer have been extracted,
and a few more will be added.
