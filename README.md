vim-clang
=========

Module to Interact with libclang (and clang\_indexer DB) from Vim.

[![Project Stats](https://www.openhub.net/p/21020/widgets/project_thin_badge.gif)](https://www.openhub.net/p/21020)

Features:
---------
* Inter-operates with clang\_indexer DB
* Displays the references of the C++ symbol under the cursor with `<leader>r`
* Displays the declaration(s) of the C++ symbol under the cursor with `<leader>d`
* Displays the Subclasses of the C++ symbol under the cursor with `<leader>s`
* Encapsulates the updating of clang\_indexer DB (which requires a project
  configuration compatible with BuildToolsWrappers format)

Installation Requirements:
-------------------------
* [Vim 7.3+](http://www.vim.org), compiled with python support
* Python 3.x
* Clang Python Bindings
* [clang\_indexer](https://github.com/LucHermitte/clang_indexer) (To Be Confirmed...)
* [lh-vim-lib](http://github.com/LucHermitte/lh-vim), v4.6.0+

Note: this module takes advantage of the following modules when they are
installed:
* [BuildToolsWrappers](http://github.com/LucHermitte/vim-build-tools-wrapper)
* my fork of Michael Geddes' [buffer-menu](http://github.com/LucHermitte/lh-misc/blob/master/plugin/buffermenu.vim)

With vim-addon-manager, just install `vim-clang`, and let VAM take care of
installing all the vim dependencies. You'll still have to install Vim, Python,
clang Python bindings, **and** clang\_indexer by yourself.

Note: this script hasn't been registered yet to VAM addons list.

Options:
--------
* The options from clang\_complete apply regarding libclang configuration
  (`[bg]:clang_user_options` that defines how to use libclang)
* `[bg]:_[{ft}_]_clic_filename` that tells where clang\_indexer database is
  located

* `g:clang_key_usr`, `g:clang_key_declarations`, `g:clang_key_references`, and
  `g:clang_key_subclasses`, to override default choices to trigger vim-clang
  features.

To do list:
-----------
* Interface _Ã  la_ `taglist()`
* Reimplements features from lh-dev and `lh-cpp#analysisLib*`.


Disclaimer:
-----------
This module is a fork of @exclipy's fork of
[clang\_complete](<https://github.com/exclipy/clang_complete>).
The functions dedicated to the interaction with clang\_indexer have been extracted,
and a few more will be added.
